# Remote Work - Extreme Edition (v0.3333)

## Overview
This is the experimental "Extreme" branch of the Remote Keyboard project. It shares the same stable core as v1.0 but is the staging ground for advanced, high-risk features.

## Current Version: v0.3333
- **Base**: Stable v1.0 (HTTPS, Token Auth, Lottery Obfuscation).
- **Status**: Experimental.

## Planned Upgrades
1.  **Eye Tracking Integration**: Control the mouse cursor using webcam-based eye tracking.
2.  **Global Connectivity**: WebRTC/Cloud Relay to allow control from outside the local network.
3.  **Advanced Gestures**: Multi-touch gesture support for the trackpad.
4.  **Voice Commands**: Execute macros via voice input.

## Usage
Same as the stable version for now. Run `run.bat` to start.
